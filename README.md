# Zeno

Zeno is a new code editor with ease-of-use in mind.

## Development disclaimer

~~This repository is still under heavy development and is currently not anywhere near a production build.~~

The [Cursive](https://github.com/Gyscos/Cursive) Rust library that this crate used does not have the best API and tends to create many unavoidable antipatterns due to the nature of dynamic closures. I may reignite this project to be a gui-based fully fledged text editor but that dream cannot currently be realised in Rust's ecosystem.
